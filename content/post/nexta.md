The issue of press freedom and censorship has remained a highly complex issue in Belarus. The government effectively owns and closely supervises most newspapers and TV channels. Furthermore, since September 9, 2001, when the authorities blocked hundreds of web outlets covering the presidential election, internet shutdowns in Belarus have become routine government activity.[^4]  
On August 9, 2020 during and immediately after the latest Belarusian presidential elections, the government again turned to sharp censorship. Internet connectivity (including mobile networks) was substantially interrupted from August 9 to 12. [^5]  According to one journalistic report into the days-long blackout, during the contested presidential election, technology and equipment purchased from a U.S. corporation helped Belarusian authorities block most of the internet and limited contact on instant messengers and social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.[^6] Telegram, an application that had already been popular with Belarusians, proved to be the most immune to these disturbances by the government. When all of Belarus went almost entirely offline, thanks to its built-in blocking-bypass feature and external proxy servers directly connected to Belarus, the messenger still operated. According to the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, the anti-censorship tools for Belarus were made available so that Telegram would still remain open to most users. [^7] The messenger, along with other services to circumvent state censorship, is among the most popular Android applications downloaded by Belarusian users. Without exaggeration, Telegram became the only source of data in the country during the internet shutdown in mid-August. [^8]
 One of the key reasons Telegram is so dear to protest movements is that it can work even if it is banned by national regulators. It can bypass most firewalls if used in combination with another software called Psiphon. 
On September 19, following the arrests at the women's march, Nexta released the personal data of more than 1,000 law enforcement officers. "We will continue to publish this data en masse if the arrests continue," Nexta's administrators warned. The channel also encouraged its subscribers to assist with the doxing, asking them via a Telegram bot to share the personal details ("addresses, telephone numbers, license plate numbers, habits, lovers") of law enforcement officers.  The list was blocked for breaching the privacy policy of Google.
No one really knows who's sponsoring this channel. The channel does not have any ads and only the names of Stepan Putilo and Roman Protasevich are known. Mr. Putilo said in the past that the money came from supporters as well as from an earlier university scholarship. His colleague told the BBC, though, that they just had ads and no donations.[^9]
