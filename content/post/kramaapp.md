Other great app that helps people to boycott products that are linked to former president A. Lukashenka is KRAMA, created by software developer Siarhei Kastrama which helps determine whether a manufacturer of a particular product is connected to Lukashenka or state-owned companies by simply scanning the barcode of the item [^1] The app is available on Android and iOS and has been downloaded over 60,000 times in just one week. [^2]
This app is important to Belarusian protests because the price of alcohol and tobacco consists of several components: benefit, taxation, like VAT, excise taxes, real manufacturing costs (salaries, depreciation, energy costs, logistics, marketing, etc.). Excise taxes are one of the sources of government income, which means that the more Belarusians drink, the more excise taxes they contribute to the Republican budget. So why is this a double blow to Belarussians?  Because the first one hits the liver with alcohol, and the second one hits the liver with a riot police baton, which is paid out of the budget.[^3]
Krama processes a barcode for the presence of a code associated with a certain manufacturer in the database. Krama issues an information message based on the barcode search results on the user's screen. Krama can identify the manufacturer by means of an international GTIN code, which is the unique identifier of the product. GTIN-Applied by the manufacturer in the form of a barcode, information on the country of manufacture, manufacturer, type of goods is encrypted in the barcode. After checking the product, the user receives an information message, which depends on whether the manufacturer has been included in the list. Each information message is accompanied by an additional color criterion (green, orange, and red) for a clearer perception of the result of the scan. [^4]
Krama cannot decipher information from the internal barcodes of retail chains, as retail chains encrypt completely different product information (manufacturer, weight, price, expiry date, etc.) than the GTIN code.  Encrypted information is non-public and unique to a particular trading network. Krama users are directly involved in the creation of a list of companies through feedback. All incoming information shall be checked by the Krama team for confirmation of the confirmed facts and all information is verified only from publicly available sources, namely respected independent media.
