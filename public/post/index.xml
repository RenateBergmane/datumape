Facial recognition has always been a field of continuous development and research due to its usage in different areas such as security and robotics. It has gained even more popularity and interest by the researchers with the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning, which improved the robustness of facial recognition systems. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person&amp;rsquo;s facial details.</description>
