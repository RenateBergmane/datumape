The nonviolent civilian demonstrations against government corruption before the internet were unknown and even silenced from the world if the government wanted it that way and that made the police and army violent and nasty and most importantly anonymous, they could violently kill and get away with unarmed civilians. Police and police Special Forces in Belarus, Minsk 2020 Special Forces are still hidden behind masks and behaving aggressively against innocent civilians-students, women, but now the time has changed-with the aid of artificial intelligence-facial recognition their faces are becoming visible and the aggression with a face can be put together by all in the world. The video has gathered over half a million views, showing how artificial intelligence can be used to unmask law enforcement officers involved in the brutal crackdown on demonstrators after Alyaksandr Lukashenka, who has led Belarus since 1994, was re-elected on August 9. 
But the government&rsquo;s opposition agents not only march on the streets with signs and loud speeches, they can be seen in other ways. NEXTA<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  is another artificial intelligence software in Belarus, a scanner that enables individuals to boycott related companies and helps Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his regime, beginning with food products companies, etc. This is a very interesting and unknown period in the history of Belarus and people are not kept in the dark for the first time in the history of Belarus, but they can spread information and unmask the people behind the violence with artificial intelligent impact.</p>
